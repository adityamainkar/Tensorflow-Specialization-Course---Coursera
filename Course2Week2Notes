Course # 2 Week 2: Image Augmentation
It helps Overfitting.
Why?
It manipulates the training set to generate more scenarios for features in the images
Raw data is as is, all augmentation is done in-memory

When using Image Augmentation my training gets...
Slowwr

When we rescale the image, it is form for data augmentation
rescale
rotation_range
width_shift_range
height_shift_range...
shear_range //shear along X-axis randomly upto given %
height_range
fill_mode: How to fill in lost pixels. nearest

How do you use Image Augmentation in TensorFLow
Using parameters to the ImageDataGenerator

When training with augmentation, you noticed that the training is a little slower. Why?
Because the image processing takes cycles
