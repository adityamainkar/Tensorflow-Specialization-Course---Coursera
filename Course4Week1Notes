Why Time Series:
1) Forcast
2) To project back into the past to see how we got to where we are now. Imputation
3) to detect anomalies.

Common Patterns:
1) Trend
2) Seasonality
3) Autocorrelation : Data that follows a predictable shape, even if the scale is different
4) nosie: Unpredictable changes in time series data

After big event, we see non-stationary time series.

The most common metric to evaluate the forecasting performance of a model is the mean squared error or mse.
Other is MAE.
This does not penalize large errors as much as the mse does. Depending on your task, you may prefer the mae or the mse. 
For example, if large errors are potentially dangerous and they cost you much more than smaller errors, then you may prefer the mse. 
But if your gain or your loss is just proportional to the size of the error, then the mae may be better.

Differencing: Technique to remove the trend and seasonality from the time series 
(1) Get  this difference time series which has no trend and no seasonality.
(2) use a moving average to forecast differnce time series 
(3) add back the value at time T minus 365
